##Object-Oriented Principles in action:

######Inheritance:
Dog and Monkey inherit from the RescueAnimal class
Dog and Monkey have traits individual to those species while RescueAnimal is more general

######Encapsulation:
All methods and properties are encapsulated in classes

######Polymorphism:
The methods in RescueAnimal are used by both child classes

######Abstraction:
RescueAnimal exposes no properties but makes them available in getters and setters
